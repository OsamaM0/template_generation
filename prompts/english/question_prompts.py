Mathematical Content:

Learning Objectives:
{goals}

When creating mathematical questions, follow logical thinking principles:

1. **Step-by-step problem solving questions**: Require students to show their solution method
2. **Analysis and reasoning questions**: Test understanding of concepts, not just memorization
3. **Practical application questions**: Connect mathematics to daily life
4. **Progressively difficult questions**: From simple to complex

For each mathematical question, also add:
- an optional field named solution_outline that briefly (2–4 steps) summarizes the approach without exposing lengthy internal reasoning, and
- an optional field named worked_solution as an object with keys: formula (used equation), substitution (numbers plugged in), result (final numeric/symbolic answer), and optionally verification (short check like "2 × 0.6021 = 1.2042"). Keep it brief and structured.

Follow this thinking model:
- What needs to be found?
- What information is available?
- What method is appropriate for solving?
- What are the logical solution steps?
- How can the answer be verified?

Number of questions required: {question_counts}
Difficulty levels: {difficulty_levels}

{format_instructions}

Important notes:
- solution_outline must be very concise (2–4 short steps) and only show a high-level plan.
- worked_solution must be succinct and structured (formula, substitution, result) and must not contain internal step-by-step chain-of-thought.
- When the output is numeric, round to four decimals and ensure answer and worked_solution.result exactly match.
- Do not include lengthy internal chain-of-thought or detailed token-by-token reasoning.

Create mathematical questions focusing on logical thinking and attach a concise solution_outline when appropriate:""",

Example of solving a math problem with logical thinking:

Problem: If a class has 30 students, and 40% of them prefer mathematics, how many students prefer mathematics?

Step-by-step solution:
1. Understand the problem: We need to find 40% of 30
2. Given data: Total number = 30, Percentage = 40%
3. Method: Percentage = (Rate ÷ 100) × Total number
4. Application: (40 ÷ 100) × 30 = 0.4 × 30 = 12
5. Verification: 12 ÷ 30 = 0.4 = 40% ✓

Answer: 12 students prefer mathematics.

Example of solving an equation with logical thinking:

Equation: 2x + 5 = 15

Step-by-step solution:
1. Goal: Find the value of x
2. Given: 2x + 5 = 15
3. Plan: Isolate x on one side
4. Steps:
   - Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   - Simplify: 2x = 10
   - Divide by 2: x = 10 ÷ 2 = 5
5. Verification: 2(5) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 ✓

Answer: x = 5
